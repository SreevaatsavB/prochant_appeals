### Decision Tree for Handling Claims Denied Due to "Paid" Status

1. **Claim Denied Due to "Paid" Status**
   - Review the claim details in Payspan.
   - Check for payment status and any details regarding the payment made.

2. **Identify Payment Amount and Date**
   - Confirm the payment date and amount from Payspan.
   - If available, reference the specific check or claim number.

3. **Validate Allowed Amount**
   - **If reimbursement is related to HCPCS Code (e.g., TC, A4606, T4525):**
     - Look up the fee schedule for the specific HCPCS code.
     - Determine the allowed payment amount based on the fee schedule.
     - **If Fee Schedule is Not Available:**
       - Calculate the allowed amount using the Cost + 10% method (Refer to Cardinal or invoice details).

4. **Compare Paid Amount to Allowed Amount**
   - If the paid amount **exceeds** the allowed amount:
     - Adjust the balance due on the claim.
     - Document the reason for adjustment and proceed to reprocess the claim if necessary.

   - If the paid amount is **within** the allowed amount:
     - Confirm the claim was paid correctly.
     - **Check if Claim was Posted:**
       - If **Not Posted**: Post the claim in the system (use software such as Caretend).
       - If **Posted**: Document the action taken for future reference.

5. **If Confirmation Needs Request:**
   - If any verification is needed regarding payments or discrepancies:
     - Contact the billing department or customer service to confirm payment status or details.

6. **End Process**
   - Ensure all actions are logged in the appropriate system (Payspan, Caretend, or Medical Portal).
   - If all actions have been completed, close the case.

### Recap of Software to Utilize
- **Payspan**: For checking payment statuses and details.
- **Caretend**: For posting claims and adjusting balances.
- **Medical Portal**: For verifying eligibility and hospital information.
