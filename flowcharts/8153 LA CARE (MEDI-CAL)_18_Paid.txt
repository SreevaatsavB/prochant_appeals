### Claim Denial Workflow for AR Team

#### Denial Reason: "Paid"

1. **Claim Denial Confirmation**
   - Confirm the claim was indeed denied with a "Paid" status.

2. **Initial Review in Payspan or Caretend**
   - Review the claim in **Payspan** or **Caretend portal**.
   - Determine if the claim has any discrepancies or was marked incorrectly.

3. **Check Claim Details**
   - Review denial notes or reason specified in the EOB (Explanation of Benefits).
   - Confirm the payment amounts for both primary and secondary insurance.

4. **Verify Payment Posting in Software** (Caretend)
   - Check if the payment against the denied claim was posted in **Caretend**.
   - If the payment is recorded, note the details, including the check number and payment amount.
   - If payment is not posted:
     - Proceed with the next steps to post the payment correctly.

5. **Calculate Paid Amount**
   - Use the claims fee schedule to verify if the payment received aligns with the expected reimbursement for the identified HCPCS codes.
   - Perform calculations: 
     - Example: Use formula for E0601 â†’ Payment = 1 * Fee * Modifier.
   - If the calculated amount differs from what was received, analyze discrepancies.

6. **Address Discrepancies**
   - **If total paid amount is less than $6.00:**
     - Adjust the balance in Caretend accordingly. No appeal should be raised if it is less than $6.
   - **If the claim was paid but not recognized due to duplicate processing:**
     - Verify with Supervisors or Accounts Receivable Lead if the denied claim can be reprocessed.

7. **Request Further Information if Needed**
   - If certain payment details are lacking:
     - Call customer service to verify any requirements (such as UPN, additional documentation).
     - If customer service confirms any necessary information is missing, request it from the patient or provider.

8. **Finalizing Payment Posting**
   - Post the payment in **Caretend**, ensuring correct amounts are reflected for both primary and secondary payments.
   - Ensure all updates are made in the software reflecting the correct financial statuses.

9. **Follow-Up Actions**
   - If confusion remains regarding payments:
     - Review patient records for any outstanding payment or co-insurance amounts due.
     - Monitor for future recoupment from any provider.
   - **Documentation:**
     - Ensure all correspondence, payment confirmations, and recalculations are documented in the system for audit trails.

10. **Appeal Process**
    - If the balance exceeds $6.00 and the payment still reflects incorrectly:
      - Raise an appeal with the necessary documents.
      - Provide evidence of payments received from primary/secondary carriers, with EOBs attached.

11. **Resolution Confirmation**
    - Confirm resolution success and update internal notes accordingly.
    - Inform related parties of any appeal outcomes or further action required.

- **Software to Review:** Payspan, Caretend
- **Calculated Payment Verification**
- **Document Everything in Caretend**
- **Communication with Patients/Providers as Necessary**
