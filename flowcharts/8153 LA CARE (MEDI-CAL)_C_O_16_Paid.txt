Certainly! Below is a structured decision tree for handling claims that have been denied due to the reason "Paid." The flowchart covers various scenarios that agents in the Accounts Receivable (AR) team may encounter. 

### Workflow for Denied Claims - Reason: "Paid"

1. **Claim Denial Reason: Paid**
   - Review the denial reason - Confirm the claim is marked as "Paid".
   - Identify the **Claim Number** and **Invoice** involved.

2. **Step 1: Check Payment Status**
   - **Action:** Review in Payspan or Payspan EOB.
   - If claim status is "Paid":
     - Proceed to Step 2.
   - If claim status is not found, check back-office software for payment confirmation.

3. **Step 2: Verify Payment Details**
   - **Action:** Check the invoicing details and dates of service (DOS).
   - Look for details, such as:
     - Check number
     - Amount paid
     - Payment date
   - Confirm if the amount received matches the allowable payment for that service.

4. **Step 3: Payment Calculation**
   - **Action:** Calculate the allowed payment amount.
   - Review the fee schedule for appropriate HCPCS codes.
   - If discrepancy exists between received payment and calculated amount:
     - Proceed to Step 4 for adjustment.
   - If the payment is correct:
     - Proceed to Step 5 for posting.

5. **Step 4: Adjust Balance**
   - **Action:** Adjust the balance if payment received exceeds the allowed amount.
   - If adjustment is necessary, document it.
   - Forward the claim to the accounting or cash team as needed.

6. **Step 5: Posting Claims**
   - **Action:** Post the payment in the system (e.g. Caretend).
   - If payment is < $6.00 and not previously posted:
     - Post payment and adjust balance accordingly.
   - Confirm posting done correctly by reviewing again in Payspan/Caretend.

7. **Step 6: Final Verification**
   - After posting, verify all payment details are correctly updated in the system.
   - Check for any remaining balance issues or further action required.

8. **Step 7: Follow-Up/Next Steps**
   - If all actions are complete, ensure:
     - Claim is closed and settled in the system.
   - If any unresolved issues or further information is needed (e.g., UPN, further documents), initiate necessary follow-up with patient/provider.

9. **Special Case: Claims Not Found in System**
   - If claims do not appear in Payspan or the medical portal:
     - **Action:** Call customer service for verification.
     - Confirm if the payment was received and its details.
     - If necessary documentation is required, request from patient or provider.
     - If documentation is obtained, update the claim and resubmit.

This decision tree provides a clear process for handling claims that were denied due to being marked as "Paid." Each step outlines necessary actions and points to the software or systems agents need to use for verification and posting. New agents should follow this flow as a reference guide when addressing these types of claim denials.
