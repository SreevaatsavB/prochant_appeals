### Workflow for Addressing Denials Due to No Authorization (AUT)

1. **Claim Denial Notification**
   - Claim was denied due to "No Auth (AUT)".
  
2. **Review Claim Details**
   - Access the claim in **Waystar** to verify the denial reason.
   - Confirm denial reason is "CO-197 for no authorization".

3. **Check Authorization Status**
   - Refer to the **Authorization Portal**.
   - Search for associated authorization numbers related to the claim.
   - If valid authorization exists:
     - Confirm details (Authorization# D22090200007, valid from 9/2/2022 to 12/7/2022).
   - If no valid authorization is found:
     - Document this finding for further review.

4. **Evaluate Authorization Timing**
   - Compare the Date of Service (DOS) (11/14/2022) with the authorization validity period.
   - If DOS falls within the valid authorization time frame:
     - Note the discrepancy and prepare to address it.
   - If DOS is outside the validity period:
     - Understand that the claim will need a new authorization.

5. **Submit Corrected Claim**
   - If valid authorization confirmed within timeframe:
     - Prepare a corrected claim submission in **Waystar**.
     - Ensure corrected claim follows TFL guidelines (180 days from DOS).
   - Provide a detailed explanation about the existing authorization within the claim notes.

6. **Follow Up on Submission**
   - Track the status of the corrected claim submission in **Waystar**.
   - If still denied:
     - Assess the reasons for continued denial with the relevant department.

7. **Raise an Appeal (if necessary)**
   - If the corrected claim does not resolve the issue:
     - Prepare an appeal with necessary documentation (authorization details, claim notes).
     - Submit the appeal to the appropriate department or insurance provider.

8. **Communication with Patient or Provider (if required)**
   - If no valid authorization is found and the DOS is outside the authorized period:
     - Contact the patient or provider to request the necessary authorization.
     - Document any correspondence for future reference.

9. **Final Resolution Documentation**
   - Once resolved—whether through resubmission or appeal—ensure to document the final resolution in **Waystar** and claim notes for future reference.
