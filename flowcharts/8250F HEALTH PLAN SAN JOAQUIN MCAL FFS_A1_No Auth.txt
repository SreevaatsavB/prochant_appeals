### Workflow for Addressing Claims Denied Due to "No Auth"

#### Step 1: Identify Denial Reason
- The claim was denied due to "No Auth."
  
#### Step 2: Review the Claim 
- Reviewed the claim in the designated claims management software (e.g., **MedImpact**, **Epic**).
- Verify the specific line items to confirm the denial reason.

#### Step 3: Check for Auth Documentation
- Search for authorization documentation in relevant systems (e.g., **AuthZ**, **Provider Portal**):
  - **If authorization documentation is found**: 
    - Verify if it covers the denied procedure.
    - If covered, proceed to resubmit the claim with the authorization attached.
  - **If authorization documentation is not found**:
    - Proceed to Step 4.

#### Step 4: Contact the Provider
- Call the providerâ€™s office to check if authorization was obtained.
  - **If authorization was obtained**: 
    - Request that they fax or email the authorization letter to you for documentation.
    - Once received, attach the authorization to the claim and resubmit.
  - **If authorization was not obtained**:
    - Proceed to Step 5.

#### Step 5: Verify Authorization Requirements
- Review the insurance policy regarding authorization requirements (check the **Payer Policy Manual**).
- Confirm if the procedure normally requires prior authorization.
  - **If prior authorization is required**:
    - Proceed to Step 6.
  - **If prior authorization is not required**:
    - Prepare to raise an appeal with the necessary documents explaining why the claim should be paid.

#### Step 6: Obtain Authorization
- Generate a request for authorization based on the relevant guidelines (use **the Authorization Request Form**).
- Submit the authorization request to the payer (via online portal or fax).
- **Wait for response:**
  - **If authorization is granted**: 
    - Document the authorization details and attach it to the claim.
    - Resubmit the claim.
  - **If authorization is denied**:
    - Document the denial and proceed to raise an appeal. 

#### Step 7: Prepare Appeal (if applicable)
- Collect all necessary documentation, including:
  - The original claim
  - Any communication with the provider
  - The payer policy manual stating no auth required (if applicable).
- Draft the appeal letter and submit to the payer's appeals department.
  
#### Step 8: Follow-Up
- Monitor the status of the resubmitted claim or appeal through the claims management software.
- Document all communications and decisions throughout the process for future reference.
