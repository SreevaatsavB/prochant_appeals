### Decision Tree for Handling Claim Denials: Paid []

#### Step 1: Identify Denial Reason
- The claim was denied due to "Paid []".
- Reviewed the claim in the billing system (e.g., Payspan).

#### Step 2: Verify Payment Information
- Check the payment report for any existing payments related to the claim.
  - If payment is listed, note the date, amount, and any reference number.
  - If no payment is found, proceed to Step 3.
  
#### Step 3: Contact the Payer
- Call the insurance company customer service to verify payment status.
  - If payment has been made, ask for payment details (date, amount).
  - If payment is not made, document the reason provided.

#### Step 4: Assess Need for Additional Information
- Check if there are additional documents or codes that need to be submitted.
  - If so, gather necessary documentation (e.g., EOB, medical records).
  - If not, proceed to Step 5.

#### Step 5: Update Claim or Appeal
- If payment information is clarified:
  - Update the claim in the billing system with new payment details.
  - Resubmit the claim to the payer.
- If payment status remains unclear or is disputed:
  - Prepare an appeal with supporting documentation (EOB, notes from customer service).
  
#### Step 6: Follow-Up
- Set reminders to follow up on the resubmitted claim or appeal after a designated period (e.g., 30 days).
- Track the progress in the accounts receivable software.

#### Step 7: Document the Process
- Ensure to log all actions taken in the appropriate software system.
- Note any conversations with customer service, including names and reference numbers.

#### Step 8: Monitor Results
- Regularly review the claims status and address any further denials as needed.
- Share findings with team to enhance understanding of similar denials in the future.
