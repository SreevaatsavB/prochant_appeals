The claim was denied due to timely filing.

1. **Review Denial:**
   - Reviewed the claim in the billing software (e.g., Zirmed, Emdeon); the reason for denial was timely filing.

2. **Check Filing Dates:**
   - Verified the original date of service (DOS) against the claim submission date.
   - Confirm if the claim was submitted within the allowable time frame per the payer's guidelines.

3. **Action Based on Filing Dates:**
   - If the claim was submitted within the timely filing limit:
     - Gather supporting documentation (e.g., proof of timely submission, emails, or confirmation receipts).
     - **Next Steps:** Proceed to appeal:
       - Draft an appeal letter outlining the reason for the late filing and attach supporting documents.
       - Submit the appeal via the payer's preferred method (e.g., online portal, fax).
   - If the claim was submitted outside the timely filing limit:
     - Evaluate if there are any valid reasons for the late filing (e.g., patient delay, system error).
     - If valid reasons are identified:
       - Gather supporting documentation for valid reasons (e.g., patientâ€™s request, technical errors).
       - Proceed to appeal following the steps above.
     - If no valid reasons are identified:
       - Document the findings in the claims system.
       - Inform the provider or patient that the claim cannot be pursued further due to timely filing issues.

4. **Monitor Appeal Status:**
   - Follow up on the appeal status through the payer's portal or by contacting their customer service.
   - Document any updates in the claims software.

5. **Final Resolution:**
   - If the appeal is accepted:
     - Update the claim status in the billing software accordingly.
     - Confirm with the provider/patient regarding the resolution.
   - If the appeal is denied:
     - Analyze the denial reason.
     - Determine if additional action (e.g., second appeal) is viable.
     - If not, communicate to the provider/patient about the final decision and potential options moving forward.

6. **Documentation:**
   - Ensure all communication, actions taken, and resolutions are documented in the claims software for future reference.
